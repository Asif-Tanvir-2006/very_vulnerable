# very_vulnerable
The blackbox of winter contribution, in this bone chilling cold, I am too lazy to function, and I don't know what the issues are, you tell me. First come, first serve, the one who raises the issue first and proposes a way to resovle it, gets points. Winter of Open Source, CodeIIEST X GDG

## Description

### This was designed to be a beginner friendly version, so do not be afraid to give this repo a shot, I know for a fact many will step back seeing it being related to cybersec, but please don't, I assure you that you will genuinely learn a thing or two. And yes, I know many will use LLMs for this, but hey that's fine, just make sure to understand what the LLM says, cause you are not getting any points if you fail to give satisfactory explanation for any issue (pointing out a vulnerability) that you might raise.
- Find out the problems
- Communicate why you think the problem is a 'problem'
- Propose a patch
- Enjoy


### What You'll Learn

- The possible horrors of Vibe Coding and its not so desirable consequences.


## Contribution Workflow

```
1. Fork the repository, clone it to your local machine, view the code, raise issues and point out vulnerabilities with clear explanation.
2. If satisfactory, the issue will be reserved for you to patch, and you will only get points after you make the necessary changes and open a PR (pull request)
3. Blatant copy pasting from LLM is discouraged, you may use LLM but you should be clear with the concept.


##Side Note -> Be a bit regular on discord channel for this repo, author needs to communicate for this repo.
